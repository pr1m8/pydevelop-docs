### What Was Working:

- Homepage structure (title, H1, sidebar)
- Performance (1 second load times)
- Responsive design
- Copy buttons on code blocks

## What Was NOT Said on August 15

No commits on August 15 mentioned:

- "terrible" (that came on Aug 17)
- "ugly" or "bad"
- Direct user complaints about CSS styling
- Marketing-style problems (though they existed)

## The Pattern

1. **Morning**: Frantically fixing template issues (4 AM - 7 AM)
2. **7:34 AM**: Added 817 lines of enhanced-design.css ("modern design")
3. **Afternoon**: More "enhancements" adding 1000+ lines
4. **Evening**: Started recognizing "over-styling" but fixes made it worse

## Key Insight

The evening commit at 8:34 PM shows **awareness** of problems:

- Knew about "over-styling"
- Knew it conflicted with Furo
- Referenced "Furo theme research" reporting issues

But the "fix" added more CSS instead of removing it, showing disconnect between:

- What they knew was wrong (over-styling)
- What they did (added more styling)

The real user feedback "the admonitions and css is terrible" came 2 days later on August 17.
