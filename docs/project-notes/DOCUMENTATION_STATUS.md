# PyAutoDoc Documentation Status

## âœ… Recovery Complete

The PyAutoDoc documentation system has been successfully recovered and is working properly.

## Current Structure

### Working Documentation System (PyAutoDoc)

Located in `docs/source/`:

- **Configuration**: Auto-generated from YAML files in `docs/config/`
- **Extensions**: 70+ Sphinx extensions configured
- **Build Script**: `./build-docs.sh` in docs directory
- **Output**: HTML documentation in `docs/build/html/`

### Documentation Files

1. **Source Files** (`docs/source/`):
   - `conf.py` - Auto-generated Sphinx configuration
   - `index.rst` - Main documentation index
   - API documentation auto-generated by AutoAPI
   - Various RST and MD files for guides

2. **Configuration** (`docs/config/`):
   - `extensions.yaml` - Extension definitions and priorities
   - `furo.yaml` - Theme configuration
   - `config_loader.py` - Configuration loading system

3. **Build Tools**:
   - `docs/build-docs.sh` - Main build script
   - `docs/Makefile` - Standard Sphinx makefile

## Building Documentation

```bash
# From project root
cd docs
./build-docs.sh

# Or using make
cd docs
make html

# View documentation
open build/html/index.html
```

## What Was Cleaned Up

During the cleanup, we removed:

- Duplicate configuration files from the monorepo system
- The conflicting `docs/conf.py` and `docs/index.rst`
- Shared configuration files that were part of a different project

## Current Features

1. **Auto-discovery** of Python packages
2. **seed-intersphinx-mapping** for automatic dependency linking
3. **Comprehensive API documentation** with AutoAPI
4. **70+ Sphinx extensions** properly configured
5. **Furo theme** with intense customization
6. **Git integration** for timestamps and history
7. **Requirements tracking** with sphinx-needs
8. **Tag system** for content organization

## Notes

- The documentation guides created earlier (user-guide.md, developer-guide.md, etc.) are supplementary documentation ABOUT PyAutoDoc
- The actual PyAutoDoc documentation system lives in `docs/source/` and is auto-generated
- The build process uses the YAML configuration system for maximum flexibility
