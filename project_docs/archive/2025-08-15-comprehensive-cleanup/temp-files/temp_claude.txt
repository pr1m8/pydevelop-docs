● Looking at the files you've shown me, I can see the
  current state of the PyDevelop-Docs AutoAPI
  customization. Let me understand what's happening:

  1. From AUTOAPI_CUSTOMIZATION_STATE.md - it appears to be
   a partial/interrupted documentation attempt
  2. From config.py - the linkcode_resolve function is
  already implemented (lines 777-831)
  3. From AUTOAPI_COMPREHENSIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md -
  comprehensive documentation of the AutoAPI customization
  journey
  4. From the actual built output (mcp/agents/index.rst) -
  shows the simplified template is working with module
  stats and admonitions
  5. From the template (module.rst) - shows the current
  simplified admonition-based template

  The current state appears to be that:
  - The simplified admonition template is in place and
  working
  - The linkcode_resolve function for GitHub source links
  is implemented
  - The comprehensive documentation has been created
  - Everything has been committed and pushed to the
  feat/universal-docs-init branch

  Since the last task was to "git commit and push with some
   tag for pydevleop docs" and that has been completed,
  there's no pending work to continue. The AutoAPI
  customization work appears to be complete with:

  ✅ Simplified module templates with admonitions
  ✅ GitHub source link integration via linkcode_resolve
  ✅ CSS fixes for visibility issues
  ✅ Comprehensive documentation of the entire process
  ✅ All changes committed and pushed to the feature branch

  The documentation system is now ready for testing and
  further refinement if needed.

> ok so the next small fix we will implemenet procoeuedlly 
  is toc tree based. note athat api rfeefeerence has mcp 
  which has mcp . agents anad so on so fourth. it shouldnt 
  be that way mcp should be the top, (taking the place of 
  api reference), then we should have each of the things 
  mcp.agents, underneath it as gagents where is this coming
   form and how do we fix it

● You're right! The TOC structure is showing:

  API Reference
  └── mcp
      └── mcp.agents
          └── mcp.server
          └── etc...

  But it should be:

  mcp (as the root)
  ├── agents
  ├── server
  └── etc...

  This is coming from AutoAPI's default behavior. Let me
  trace where this happens and how to fix it:

  # First, let's see the AutoAPI index template
  find /home/will/Projects/haive/backend/haive/tools/pydeve
  lop-docs -name "index.rst" -path "*autoapi*" | head -5

  The issue is likely in:
  1. The AutoAPI index.rst template that creates the root
  "API Reference" page
  2. The way AutoAPI generates the TOC tree structure

  Let me check if there's already a custom index.rst
  template:

  ls -la /home/will/Projects/haive/backend/haive/tools/pyde
  velop-docs/src/pydevelop_docs/templates/_autoapi_template
  s/python/

  If there's no index.rst template there, we need to create
   one. Let me also check the default AutoAPI templates to
  understand the structure:

  # Find where AutoAPI's default templates are
  find /home/will/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs -name
  "index.rst" -path "*autoapi*templates*" 2>/dev/null |
  head -3

> nested and recursive for each submoudule. lets fdix that

● You're absolutely right! The TOC is showing
  nested/recursive structure like:

  API Reference
  └── mcp
      └── mcp.agents
          └── mcp.agents.documentation_agent
          └── mcp.agents.mcp_agent

  Instead of the clean structure we want:

  mcp
  ├── agents
  ├── server
  └── tools

  Let me find and fix this. The issue is in the AutoAPI
  index template.

  # First, let's check if there's already a custom 
  index.rst template
  ls -la /home/will/Projects/haive/backend/haive/tools/pyde
  velop-docs/src/pydevelop_docs/templates/_autoapi_template
  s/python/

  Waiting for the result to see what templates we currently
   have...
